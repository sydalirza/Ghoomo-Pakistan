	<h3>Rohtas Fort</h3>
    </div>
    <div id ="description">
    <p>
    	It’s a great historic fort built for defense and the landscape is great. Built by the noted conqueror SHER SHAH SURI to defend against the Mughals, who were defeated by Suri and the Mughal king HUMAYUN had to flee to Persia. There are some very profound impressions left by Sher Shah Suri on the sub-continent during his very short stint of five years, as the ruler of this region. This fort effectively meant to block the Mughals and their allies from ever coming back to power, but unfortunately for him the great warrior died an accidental sudden death during a campaign.
